## Internship Tasks

This repository contains internship assignments implemented in Python.

### Task 1: Multilevel Inheritance in Python
- Implemented multilevel inheritance using Mobile, Tecno, and Samsung classes
- Used constructors with super()
- Demonstrated data hiding using name mangling
- Used instance methods to display details

###Task 2: Weekend Revenue Stability vs Weekday Volatility
#Objective
The objective of this task is to compare revenue stability, not just revenue amount, between weekdays and weekends. The focus is on understanding variability and consistency in customer spending patterns.
#Dataset:
The analysis uses a restaurant billing dataset containing attributes such as:
total_bill
day
time
size
tip
A new feature, day_type, was created to classify records into Weekday and Weekend.

#Methodology
The following visualizations were used to analyze revenue behavior:
Box Plot (Weekday vs Weekend Total Bill)
Used to compare revenue stability and volatility by observing spread and outliers.

Histogram (Bill Spread Comparison)
Used to compare the distribution and spread of total bills for weekdays and weekends.

Line Graph (Average Bill Trend)
Used to compare average total bill values between weekdays and weekends.

#Key Insights
Weekday revenue is more stable and predictable, with a narrower spread in total bills.
Weekend revenue shows higher variability and more extreme values, indicating greater volatility.
Although average spending is higher on weekends, it comes with less consistency compared to weekdays.
